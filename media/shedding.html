		She sang swan songs to children<br>
With less than ten feathers, their flock hanging by threads.<br>
She gave them fuel for the blazes in their hearts, of rebellion,<br>
Of dreaming, hurting, fighting<br>
Fractured homes.<br>
Never alone, you could see graves in her thoughts,<br>
Resting souls wilted from years gone by.<br>
She could feel her husk shedding as she gave thick skin to young children<br>
and her fears became childish,<br>
and her weakness evaporated,<br>
and her tongue became gold from silver,<br>
and her pen spouted words of juvenile angst and elderly wisdom.<br>
To this day, she sheds still. <br>
